        <p>
          About to be a dad and trying to make sense of pregnancy, what to do,
          and where to start? The Father’s Playbook app is here to help. This
          app is developed for guys to help them understand pregnancy and
          prepare them for after the baby comes. The app covers topics related
          to financial planning for the baby, understanding what your partner is
          going through, helping her during the pregnancy, tips on taking care
          of yourself, and help with understanding all those medical terms.
        </p>
        <p>The Father’s Playbook Privacy Statement</p>
        <p>
          This privacy statement describes the information we collect about our
          users, how we use the information, and explains sharing of information
          with third parties, if any. Updates to this privacy statement may
          occur from time to time, but we will release these updates as soon as
          they occur and notify our users.
        </p>
        <p>Information We Collect and Receive:</p>
        <p>
          The Father’s Playbook, “App”, will collect and receive two types of
          information from you: (1) user information and (2) other usage data,
          collectively “User Data” in a couple of ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            User information– this is gathered at the time you sign up to use
            the App and once you log in to the App. This information includes:
            your email (username), a password created by you, general
            demographic information such as zip code, age, race and ethnicity,
            and sex (M/F), your baby’s due date.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other Usage Data– this is information gathered as you interact with
            the App such as language preference, information articles that you
            access in the app, information articles that you “favorite” in the
            app, the time when you accessed an article, answers to survey
            questions that you complete and other settings you select within the
            App.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>

            growth, health, and development, including reminders for pre-natal
            appointments;
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>As required by applicable laws, legal process or regulation;</li>
          <li>
            To send you updates about the App or changes made to this privacy
            statement
          </li>
        </ul>
